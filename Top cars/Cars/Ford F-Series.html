        The thirteenth-generation Ford F-Series is a range of pickup trucks produced by Ford. Introduced for the 2015 model year, this generation of the 
        F-Series is the first aluminum-intensive vehicle produced on a large scale by an American vehicle manufacturer. For the 2017 model year, the
         fourth-generation Super Duty line adopted the cab design of the F-150, consolidating the cab design for the first time on Ford light-duty trucks 
         (F-550 and below) for the first time since the 1996 model year; the Super Duty trucks still retain separate bodywork and a heavier-duty frame. <br>

<p>After a two-year hiatus, a second generation of the Ford Raptor made its return for 2017 as a high-performance variant of the F-150,
 dropping the SVT prefix. In Mexico, the F-Series XL trim is marketed as the F-150, XLT and higher trims are named Lobo (Wolf in Spanish).[5] 
 The Mexican-market Lincoln Mark LT was discontinued completely, replaced by the Platinum and Limited trims sold elsewhere. </p>

<p>The thirteenth-generation F-Series was produced by Ford in Claycomo, Missouri (Kansas City Assembly), alongside the Ford Transit van, 
and at Dearborn, Michigan (Dearborn Truck Plant). </p>
<h2>Design </h2>
The thirteenth-generation F-Series was unveiled at the 2014 North American International Auto Show on January 13, 2014.[6] It was nearly identical to the Atlas concept 
from 2013, but now in a production model F-150 (with the only exception of the wheel design, roof rails, side mirrors, instrument panel, and blue lighting; 
the retractable rear spoiler never made it to production), albeit 700 lbs lighter. A number of safety technologies and driver assistance features were introduced
as options, including: 360° camera, adaptive cruise control, collision warning with brake support, blind spot information system (BLIS) with rear cross-traffic alert, 
and a lane-keeping system.
<p>While not actually the first aluminum-bodied vehicle developed by Ford (the company developed 40 aluminum-bodied Mercury Sable prototypes in 1993, reducing curb weight by 
    400 pounds[7]), the F-Series was the first Ford aluminum-bodied vehicle to make it to production.[7] While changing the metal composition of the best-selling vehicle in
     the United States, 85% of the parts of the vehicle were domestically-sourced (as of 2016).</p>
     <p>When the F-150 was equipped with the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine and two-wheel drive, it was able to comply with proposed future CAFE standards through 2024 
        without any modifications.</p>
        <h2>Body</h2>
        In line with its predecessor, the thirteenth-generation F-150 is sold with three cab configurations (two-door regular cab, 2+2 door SuperCab, four-door SuperCrew), with rear-wheel drive or 
        four-wheel drive (4×4). Three bed lengths are available (dependent on cab configuration): 5.5 ft (1.7 m) (SuperCrew, all Raptors), 6.5 ft (2.0 m) (all except Raptor), 8 ft (2.4 m) (regular cab, 
        SuperCab).
        <p>The 2015 F-150 marked several design departures from previous F-Series model lines. While the cab design saw largely evolutionary styling changes, the rectangular 
            grille adopted a trapezoidal shape, flanked by C-shaped headlamp units. Using LED headlights for the first time, designers used polycarbonate thermoplastic optics to focus the beams, 
            with one LED for each beam and an orange thermoplastic light pipe (doubling as the turn signal).[17] Coupled with the headlamps, the taillamps adopted LED technology, also housing the 
            blind spot monitor; these systems were not typically included on any truck because the system could not be packaged inside steel bumpers typically found on them.[17] The tailgate was redesigned;
             along with retaining its fold-out step  functionality, it adopted several different styles (dependent on trim).</p>
