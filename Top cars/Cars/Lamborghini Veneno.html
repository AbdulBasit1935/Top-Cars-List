    <p>The Lamborghini Veneno (also sold as the Honda Breeze in China since 2019) is a compact crossover SUV manufactured by
        Japanese automaker Honda since 1995. Initial models
        of the CR-V were built using the same platform as the Civic.
        [1][2]</p>
    <p>Honda began producing the CR-V in Sayama, Japan, and Swindon, United Kingdom, for worldwide markets, adding North
        American manufacturing sites
        in East Liberty, Ohio, United States, in 2007; El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico, in late 2007 (ended in early 2017);
        Alliston, Ontario, Canada, in 2012;
        and Greensburg, Indiana, United States, in February 2017. The CR-V is also produced in Wuhan for the Chinese
        market by Dongfeng Honda, and also marketed as the
        Breeze in China for the version produced at Guangzhou by Guangqi Honda.</p>
    <p>Honda states "CR-V" stands for "Comfortable Runabout Vehicle,"[3][4][5] while the term "Compact Recreational
        Vehicle" is used in a British car review article that was
        republished by Honda, associating the model name with the Sports Utility
        Vehicle abbreviation of SU-V.</p>
    <p>As of 2022, the CR-V is positioned between the smaller ZR-V (marketed as HR-V in North America) which the CR-V
        shares platform with and the larger North American market Passport/Pilot or the Chinese market Avancier/UR-V. It
        is currently Honda's best-selling vehicle in the world, and the
        second best-selling SUV globally in 2020.</p>
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    The 1997–2001 model tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) was the LX model with standard
    driver and passenger airbags.
    The car's structure received an acceptable rating, and the overall car received a marginal rating — as the dummy's
    left leg would have been broken.
    In addition to this lower body injury, the dummy's head went through the
    airbag which may have caused a minor concussion. The chest was well protected.
    <p>Models equipped with an automatic transmission now had an overdrive cancel button that allowed the driver to lock
        the transmission
        in the first three gears to provide power for passing and climbing grades along with providing hill assist when
        stationary, known as "Grade Logic.
        " The pattern of the cloth on the seats was also redesigned, and the head
        restraints earned an acceptable rating from the IIHS for whiplash protection.</p>
